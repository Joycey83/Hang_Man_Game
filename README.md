# HANGMAN GAME

For my portfolio 3 project I have chosen a fun school favourite, a well known game called Hangman. This game Hangman will be displayed in a Python terminal, which runs through the Code Institute terminal on Heroku.

# How to play Hangman
Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers, within a certain number of guesses.
However, in this game, one player is only needed as the words are automatically randomized and the lives will automatically be deducted for any incorrect guess. The User will enters their desired Username and the game will select a random word from a word list.
The word to be guessed will be displayed as _ _ _ _ _ and with an image of a hangman in different stages depending on the number of incorrect guesses. In this game the player will have 8 attempts to guess the correct letters for the word. When the User guesses a letter that is in the random word, the terminal will display the correct letter guessed, this will replace the blank dashes _ _ _ with the correct letter and in the correct position, in this example the letter “t” will replace the third blank space of the random word _ _t. This process will continue until the player has run out of guesses and then will be 'You are HANGED in the gallows!!' on a platform.  This will be shown on the terminal and a message letting the User know they have 'died' and have lost the game. The other option will be that the User continued guessing the correct letters and got the correct word before running out of lives. When the User has either wins or loses, they will have the option to play again.
